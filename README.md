`optics-ts` provides type-safe, ergonomic, polymorphic optics for
TypeScript:

- **Optics** allow you to read or modify values from deeply nested
  data structures, while keeping all data immutable.
- **Ergonomic**: Optics are composed with method chaining, making it
  easy and fun!
- **Polymorpic**: When writing through the optics, you can change the
  data types in the nested structure.
- **Type-safe**: The compiler will type check all operations you do.
  No `any`, ever.

`optics-ts` supports equivalences, isomorphisms, lenses, prisms and
traversals.

## Tutorial

The following import is assumed in all the examples below:

```typescript
import * as O from 'optics-ts'
```

### Lens

Lens is the most common optic you're going to use. You can create an
optic for a data structure by calling `O.optic()`, and turn in into a
lens that focuses on a property of an object with `.prop()`:

```typescript
type Data = {
  foo: { bar: number }
  other: string
}
const foo = O.optic<Data>().prop('foo')
```

`foo` is now a lens that focuses on `Data.foo`.

To dig deeper, just call `.prop()` again:

```typescript
const bar = O.optic<Data>()
  .prop('foo')
  .prop('bar')
// or from the `foo` lens we defined above
const bar = foo.prop('bar')
// or use .path() to compose multiple prop lenses with a single call
const bar = O.optic<Data>().path(['foo', 'bar'])
```

Use `get()` to read a value through the lens:

```typescript
const data: Data = {
  foo: { bar: 42 },
  other: 'stuff',
}

O.get(lens)(data)
// => 42
```

Use `set()` or `modify()` to write the focused value through the lens:

```typescript
O.set(lens)(99)(data)
// => {
//   foo: { bar: 99 },
//   other: 'stuff'
// }

O.modify(lens)(x => x * 100)(data)
// => {
//   foo: { bar: 4200 },
//   other: 'stuff'
// }
```

Writing through optics always creates a new data structure instead of
modifying the existing one. In other words, data is immutable.

### Prism

Lenses are great for focusing to a part of a larger structure. Prisms
come in handy when you want to focus on a branch of a union type:

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string
  age?: number | undefined
}

const age = O.optic<User>()
  .prop('age')
  .optional()
```

`.optional()` creates a prism that focuses on the non-`undefined`
branch of a type, `number` in this case.

You read through a prism using the `preview()` function:

```typescript
const userWithAge: User = {
  name: 'Betty',
  age: 42,
}
O.preview(age)(userWithAge)
// ==> 42

const userWithoutAge: User = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: undefined,
}
O.preview(age)(userWithoutAge)
// ==> undefined
```

If the prism doesn't match, `preview()` returns undefined, as seen above.

You can write through a prism normally with `set()` and `modify()`. If
the prism doesn't match, the value is unchanged:

```typescript
O.modify(age)(n => n + 1)(userWithAge)
// ==> {
//   name: 'Betty',
//   age: 43,
// }

O.set(age)(60)(userWithoutAge)
// ==> {
//   name: 'Max',
//   age: undefined,
// }
```

`.guard()` is another method that creates a prism. Use it to match on
the branches of discriminated unions:

```typescript
interface Square {
  kind: 'square'
  size: number
}
interface Rectangle {
  kind: 'rectangle'
  width: number
  height: number
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle

function isRectangle(s: Shape): s is Rectangle {
  return s.kind === 'rectangle'
}

const rectWidth = O.optic<Shape>()
  .guard(isRectangle)
  .prop('width')

O.preview(rectWidth)({ kind: 'square', size: 10 })
// ==> undefined

O.preview(rectWidth)({ kind: 'rectangle', width: 5, height: 7 })
// ==> 5

O.modify(rectWidth)(w => w * 2)({ kind: 'rectangle', width: 5, height: 7 })
// ==> { kind: 'rectangle', width: 10, height: 7 })
```

Notice how above we used `.guard(...).prop(...)`, composing a prism with
a lens. This yields a prism, so we used `preview()` to read through it.
See [Types of optics](#types-of-optics) for the rules of composition.

### Traversal

The next optic type is the traversal. While lenses have 1 focus and
prisms have 0 or 1 focus (no match or match), traversals have 0 or
more focuses.

The simplest example of a traversal is to focus on the elements of an
array. To create such a traversal, use `.elems()`:

```typescript
type Person {
  name: string
  friends: Person[]
}

const friendsNames = O.optic<Person>()
  .prop('friends')
  .elems()
  .prop('name')
```

To read through a traversal, call `collect()` to collect all focused
elements into an array:

```typescript
const john = { name: 'John', friends: [] }
const bruce = { name: 'Bruce', friends: [] }
const amy = { name: 'Amy', friends: [john, bruce] }

O.collect(friendsNames)(amy)
// ==> [ 'John', 'Bruce' ]
```

Writing through a traversal writes to all focused values:

```typescript
O.modify(friendsNames)(name => `${name} Wayne`)(amy)
// ==> {
//   name: 'Amy',
//   friends: [
//     { name: 'John Wayne', friends: [] },
//     { name: 'Bruce Wayne', friends: [] },
//   ],
// }
```

Note again how we used `.prop(...).elems(...).prop(...)`, composing a
lens with a traversal, and then with a lens again. This yields a
traversal. See [Types of optics](#types-of-optics) for more info.

### Other types of optics

In fact, calling `O.optic()` also yields an optic, but instead of
being a lens, prism or traversal, it's an equivalence. As the name
suggests, equivalence keeps the value equal, in both reading and
writing directions:

```typescript
const str = O.optic<string>()

get(str)('original')
// ==> 'original'

set(str)('new')('original')
// ==> 'new' ('original' is discarded)
```

`optics-ts` also supports isomorphisms, which can be used to do 2-way
transformations on data.

### Polymorphism

Optics are polymorphic, which means you can change the type of the
focus when you write through an optic. Since this is a relatively rare
use case, and may be confusing if done by accident, polymorphic optics
are created with `optic_()` (note the underscore):

```typescript
type Data = {
  foo: { bar: string }
  other: boolean
}
const bar = O.optic_<Data>().path(['foo', 'bar'])
```

Let's modify the focused string to contain the length of the string
instead:

```typescript
const data: Data = {
  foo: { bar: 'hello there' },
  other: true,
}

const updated = O.modify(bar)(str => str.length)(data)
// ==> {
//   foo: { bar: 11 },
//   other: true
// }
```

This is a type-safe operation, i.e. the compiler knows that
`typeofupdated.foo.bar` is `number`, editor autocomplete works
correctly, etc.

If you ever see a `DisallowedTypeChange` type being returned from an
`optics-ts` function, it means that you tried to change a type when
using a monomorphic optic.

## API reference

### Types of optics

The supported optic classes are equivalence, isomorphism, lens, prism
and traversal. With this (incomplete) optics hierarchy, we can put the
optic classes in order:

```
Equivalence < Iso < Lens < Prism < Traversal
```

When you compose two optics, the result is the "greater" of the two,
i.e. the one that appears rightmost.

For example, composing an `Iso` with a `Prism` yields a `Prism`.
Composing an `Traversal` with a `Lens` yields a `Traversal`.

### Method chaining

Optics are composed with method chaining. This means that each optic
type has all the methods documented below. The only difference is the
return type, which is determined by the composition rules above.

For example, assume we have a variable `optic` that holds a `Lens`, and
call `.optional()` on it:

```typescript
const newOptic = optic.optional()
```

`.optional()` creates a prism, so `newOptic` will be a composition of
lens and prism, i.e. a prism.

### Type parameters

All optics have 3 type parameters: `<S, T, A>`:

- `S` is the source on which the optic operates

- `A` is the type of the focus or focuses

- `T` is a "partially applied type operator" that, applied to some
  type `B`, creates the output type. Conceptually, the output type is
  `S`, but with `A` replaced with `B`. This construct makes it
  possible for the optics to be polymorphic.

In the following, we leave the exact definition of `T` for each optic
out for clarity, writing just `_` in its place. It's usually clear fom
the definition of the optic what will come out if you put a different
type in.

In the documentation of functions that can be used to write through an
optic, the return type is denoted by `T<B>`. While not valid
TypeScript syntax, this captures the meaning quite well: `B` is
applied to the higher-kind type `T`, yielding the final output type.

Interested readers can refer to [hkt.ts](src/hkt.ts) to see how the
higher-kinded types / partially applied type operators are actually
implemented.

### Top-level functions

These functions are available as top level exports of the `optics-ts`
module.

Most functions have `Optic` in their signature. It means that multiple
optics work with the function. The optic classes that are actually
applicable are documented in the function description.

#### `optic<S>(): Equivalence<S, _, S>`

Create a monomorphic equivalence for `S`. If you ever see the type
`DisallowedTypeChange`, it means that you have attempted to change a
type with a monomorphic optic.

#### `optic_<S>(): Equivalence<S, _, S>`

Create a polymorphic equivalence for `S`.

#### `get<S, A>(optic: Optic<S, _, A>) => (source: S) => A`

Read a value through a `Lens`, `Iso` or `Equivalence`.

#### `preview<S, A>(optic: Optic<S, _, A>) => (source: S) => A | undefined`

Read a value through a `Prism` or `Traversal`. For `Prism`, return
`undefined` if the prism doesn't match. For `Traversal`, returns the
value of the first focus, or `undefined` if there are no focuses.

#### `collect<S, A>(optic: Traversal<S, _, A>) => (source: S) => A[]`

Read all focused values through a `Prism` or `Traversal`. For `Prism`,
the return value is an array of 0 or 1 elements. For `Traversal`, the
return value is an array of zero or more elements.

#### `modify<S, T, A>(optic: Optic<S, T, A>) => <B>(f: (a: A) => B) => (source: S) => T<B>`

Modify the focused value(s) through an `Equivalence`, `Iso`, `Lens`,
`Prism` or `Traversal`. Returns an updated copy of `source` with all
focuses modified by mapping them through the function `f`.

#### `set<S, T, A>(optic: Optic<S, T, A>) => <B>(value: B) => (source: S) => T<B>`

Set a value or values through an `Equivalence`, `Iso`, `Lens`, `Prism`
or `Traversal`. Returns an updated copy of `source` with all focuses
replaced by `value`.

### Creating optics

The methods documented below are available on all optics types:
`Equivalence`, `Iso`, `Lens`, `Prism` and `Traversal`. The documented
return type is the type of the optic that these methods create. The
actual return type is the composition of the optic on which the method
is called and on the optic that the method creates.

### Isomorphisms

Isomorphisms have the type `Iso<S, T, A>`. In the following, we omit
the exact definition of `T` for clarity, and use `_` instead. See
[Type parameters](#type-parameters) for the meanings of type
parameters.

#### `iso<U>(there: (a: A) => U, back: (u: U) => A): Iso<S, _, U>`

Create an isomorphism from functions `there` and `back`. `there` takes
the focus and transforms it to another value. `back` is the inverse of
`there`.

Note that `iso` is monomorphic, so it cannot be used to change the
type of the focus.

### Lenses

Lenses have the type `Lens<S, T, A>`. In the following, we omit the
exact definition of `T` for clarity, and use `_` instead. See [Type
parameters](#type-parameters) for the meanings of type parameters.

#### `prop<K extends keyof A>(key: K): Lens<S, _, A[K]>`

Create a lens that focuses on the property `K` of the focus.

**Note:** Only works for string properties, even though TypeScript
also allows array's numeric indices when using `keyof`. Use the
`index()` prism to focus on an array element at a given index.

#### `path<K1, K2, ...>(keys: [K1, K2, ...]): Lens<S, _, A[K1][K2]...>`

A shortcut for focusing on chain of properties.

```typescript
foo.path(['a', 'b', 'c'])
```

is equal to

```typescript
foo
  .prop('a')
  .prop('b')
  .prop('c')
```

#### `pick<K extends keyof A>(keys: K[]): Lens<S, _, Pick<A, K>>`

Create a lens that focuses on a sub-object of `A` with the given
properties. When writing through a polymorphic `.pick()` lens, you can
add or remove properties.

### Prisms

Prisms have the type `Prism<S, T, A>`. In the following, we omit the
exact definition of `T` for clarity, and use `_` instead. See [Type
parameters](#type-parameters) for the meanings of type parameters.

#### `optional(): Prism<S, _, Exclude<A, undefined>>`

Create a prism that focuses on the non-`undefined` subtype of `A`.

#### `guard<U extends A>(g: (a: A) => a is U): Prism<S, _, U>`

Create a prism that focuses on the subtype of `A` that matches the
type guard `g`.

When composed further, this prism monomorphizes the optic from this
point on. Use `guard_` if you want a polymorphic guard.

#### `guard_<F extends HKT>(): <U extends A>(g: (a: A) => a is U) => Prism<S, T Â· F, U>`

Create a prism that focuses on the subtype of `A` that matches the type
guard `g`. When written to, uses the higher-kinded type `F` to construct
the output type.

#### `index(i: number): Prism<S, _, ElemType<A>>`

Only works on array types. `ElemType<A>` is the element type of the
array type `A`.

Create a prism that focuses on index `i` of the focus array.

When a different type `B` is written through this optic, the resulting
array will have the type `Array<A | B>`.

#### `find(p: (e: ElemType<A>) => boolean): Prism<S, _, ElemType<A>>`

Only works on array types. `ElemType<A>` is the element type of the
array type `A`.

Like `.index()`, but the index to be focused on is determined by
finding the first element that matches the given predicate.

When a different type `B` is written through this optic, the resulting
array will have the type `Array<A | B>`.

#### `when(f: (a: A) => boolean): Prism<S, _, A>`

Create a prism that skips the focus if it doesn't match the given
predicate. Especially useful for filtering the focuses of a travesal.

When a different type `B` is written through this optic, the resulting
value will have the type `A | B`.

### Traversals

Traversals have the type `Traversal<S, T, A>`. In the following, we
omit the exact definition of `T` for clarity, and use `_` instead. See
[Type parameters](#type-parameters) for the meanings of type
parameters.

#### `elems(): Traversal<S, _, ElemType<A>>`

Only works on array types. `ElemType<A>` is the element type of the
array type `A`.

Create a traversal that focuses on all the elements of the array.
